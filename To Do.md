Goals of this project:

- Describing the most beautiful physical device ever envisaged and built in a Deutschian poetic way
- Explaining some computational tasks done by hand over centuries to demonstrate what computation and information is.
- Explaining the giants of the field and their problem-situation and dreams.
- Explaining the physical principles for building a computer (mechanical and electric)
- Explaining and programming the challenges after building of a computer: languages and abstractions, problems that OS solves, communication of two or more computers(explaining the underlying physics), protocols, browsers, how to think about designing software system for solving real world problems.
- Describing the most beautiful program envisaged but not programmed yet and another physical device that is cooler than computer (Universal Constructor).
