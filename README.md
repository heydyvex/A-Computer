Dreaming and Envisaging  
Designing and Building  
Programming few things  
##### Universality and Laws of Nature.

For long people were in pursuit of building a perpetual motion machine -- a motion continuing forever in a vacuum without external energy or interference. Possibility of existing such device had become a cultural phenomenon and popular, a simple process while looked exciting and fun that many tried to build over centuries eventually was explained and understood to be impossible and forbidden by laws of nature.  
Now if one were to dream of a device such that set of all possible motions it can perform is the set of all motions allowed by the laws of nature, that is, it is *Universal* and can replicate and perform *all* physical processes that are possible in nature. We shall call such Device in question Computer.  
Our wondered Computer is capable of instantiating abstract objects and their relationships in physical objects and their motion. We call this abstract object *information* which the Computer can carry on number of operations on including: *store*, *copy* and *transform* operations, we shall call unit of information *bit* . Abstract objects can represent anything. The Computer with that Universal reach is capable of helping with enormous problems and tasks of all people with various professions and hobbies.  
Would the dream of such device cease to exist due to restriction imposed by laws of physics or it is very much possible to build one?

The Computer we are dreaming of in principle is equivalent to one of Human's organs namely the brain, the only, but *very* important difference is that the brain has a very special innate abstract object called the mind. The brain follows the principle that is described above, its repertoire is the set of all process that laws of physics allow. How could you explain humans' ability to wonder and understand the captivating beautiful ideas like music, art, numbers, mathematical structures, enormous physical objects such as stars and blackholes in our vast universe and the smallest objects that everything else is made out of, including the Brain itself, without explaining the Computer and its special property, that is, *Universality*.  
Now we shall change the name of our device and call it Universal Computer, the reason is that there can be other kind of Computer that have non-universal repertoire made for specific tasks, one might build a device for doing only arithmetic, so its reach is parochial and bounded.  
Think of Abstract Object as paper or file which we shall call program or software. from the computer perspective it can be composed of instructions or non-instruction information or both. Former tells the computer to carry on operations on the latter, both are very interdependent. From our perspective non-instruction information, which we shall call data for convenience, might be very crucial or useful like a deep explanation and knowledge. but from our Universal Computer perspective it is just data, a piece of information to carry on operations upon.  
The difference between the Universal Computer and the Brain as I mentioned above is that the Brain contains a special abstract object, a program or software, that is much more fascinating than Universal Computer if not less. Among Universality of the Brain there has to be another property that gives a person the capacity to wonder, understand and explain the world. And that software is called *creativity*. A mind constitutes a *personhood* of a human, it is composed of Creativity program and other abstract objects like desires, feelings, experiences and theories about the world. Creativity is the program of understanding and explaining anything that is possible to understand given the laws of nature and this principle is called *Explanatory* or *Creativity Universality*. There is a deep relationship between Computational Universality of Computer and Creativity Universality of Mind, latter couldn't be possible without the former.
The mind due to creativity is novel, inherently disobedient and deeply unpredictable. There are cultural and moral implication involved with it regarding personhood. On the other hand our Universal Computer has no abstract object of any kind like creativity, it is mindless and blindly follows instruction and it is obedient .
One problem remains unsolved and that is our Computer can’t make a copy of itself into the physical world. Computer is a box, it can compute and simulate all the artifact that are possible given the right program, but it can’t construct matter to built physical objects like a copy of its own.

	"The truth is that all human activity is some manipulation of matter by energy, according to some pattern of information." - Peter Hague

The course of discovery consists of creative acts and automatic tasks, if an action is repetitive and not creative then it can and should be a automatic task. I don’t think a person wishes to do toil and repetitive tasks. Computers are of a great help to us but problem of constructional tasks remains unsolved, if we imagine a Computer that is capable of constructing a copy of itself and anything else that is possible by laws of nature then we have a *Universal Constructor*.

It is an astonishing fact that laws of nature allow the property of Universality and Universal objects and artifacts to exist which we went through three forms: Explanatory Creativity, Computational and Constructional Universality. And it’s a beautiful and deep relationship that exist between us and nature, we can explain it and it is explainable.

Living in ancient Greece, if one were to dream of building such a device just to automate its

- first make the dream more clear and explain what
- then explain *why* such device is possible by laws of physics
- explain how to build one
- explain it from information perspective
- explain quantum info and computing

There is an explanation for why idea of a perpetual motion machine is impossible, so an explanation for possibility or impossibility of existence of our Universal device is needed.

it's rare for one device to be used for everything, to test and simulate theories or be used as extended memory, to send photos or a piece of music at the speed of light to one another, to store giant amount of information in a device size of hand palm.

That reach of usefulness is because of a Fascinating property called *Computational Universality*, It can simulate every physical and logical process, and manipulate information in every form that is *possible*.

Once Universality understood, one is captivated by the laws of nature that allow such a device to exist, sparks wonder and imagination of potential problems that are soluble and enormous wealth that are consequences of it.

This device and its Universal property captures the beauty of nature and its laws, the feeling of wonder and excitement that it creates for a human mind is or should be not only equivalent but much greater than giants like stars, blackholes and their *simple* processes (one of them remains to be unknown), that's because repertoire of physical processes in a computer is universal and it can in principle simulate any other object, including those that are mentioned.
