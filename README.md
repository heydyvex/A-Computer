There is a device that can do simulation, manipulation, computation on information. the reach and boundary of its capability is unlimited and universal. it can compute infinite set of physical and logical processes. if there is something it can’t do that’s because laws of physics forbids it.
It's Universal reach solves infinite problems, allows generating enormous amount of wealth and that’s is why it’s everywhere around us. It's called Computer.

This project aims to understand the theoretical and practical aspects of A Computer.
